  <h2>Project Overview</h2>
  <p>This dataset was taken from Maven Analytics website. </p>
  <img src="./Images/coffee_shop_data.png" alt="coffee shop data">
  <h3>Power Query</h3>
  <p>The initial data cleaning process was done in Power Query. Data type of transaction_time was changed to "Time" and an extra column to calculate the total
    price was created by multiplying quantity and unit_price. The cleaned dataset contains 149,117 rows and 12 columns.</p>
  <h3>DAX measures</h3>
  <p>A new table was created called DateTable. This included five columns:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Date:</strong> DateTable = CALENDAR(MIN(coffee_shop[transaction_date]), MAX(coffee_shop[transaction_date]))</li>
    <li><strong>Year</strong> = YEAR(DateTable[Date])</li>
    <li><strong>Month Number</strong> = MONTH(DateTable[Date])</li>
    <li><strong>Month Name</strong> = FORMAT(DateTable[Date], "MMMM")</li>
    <li><strong>YearMonth</strong> = FORMAT(DateTable[Date], "YYYY-MM")</li>
  </ul>
  <img src="./Images/coffee_shop_dateTable.png" alt="coffee shop date table">
  <p>Another three columns were also added to the existing Coffee Shop dataset.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>HourOfDay</strong> = HOUR(coffee_shop[transaction_time])</li>
    <li><strong>DayOfWeek</strong> = FORMAT(coffee_shop[transaction_date], "dddd")</li>
    <li><strong>DayOfWeekNumber</strong> = WEEKDAY(coffee_shop[transaction_date], 2)</li>
  </ul></br>
  <p>These DAX measures were created to transform the transaction dates and times into meaningful time dimensions,
    which were then used to build the summary visualisations in the dashboard.</p>

    <h2 class="with_space">Sales Overview- Page One</h2>
    <p>This Power BI dashboard presents a dynamic overview of sales performance for a coffee shop chain over six months.
        The goal of this report was to provide clear, data-driven insights into overall revenue trends,
        product performance, and customer purchasing patterns.</p>

    </ul>

    <h2 class="with_space">Product Performance - Page Two</h2>
    <p>Page two focuses on analyzing product-level performance across different categories, locations, and time periods.
        The dashboard provides a detailed view of sales distribution, unit pricing, and customer purchasing patterns, 
        helping the coffee shop identify its most profitable and popular products.</p></br>
        <p>Interactive slicers for Category and Month allow users to dynamically filter data and uncover trends by specific product category or time frames.</p>

    <h3>Key Metrics and Insights</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Total Sales Overview:</strong>The company achieved a total of $698.81K in sales across all stores, with relatively even performance among the three locations.</li>

This suggests that although Hell’s Kitchen sells more overall, customers at Lower Manhattan spend slightly more per transaction.</li>
<h3>Interactivity and Design</h3>
        <li><strong>Slicers:</strong>Used slicers for store location filtering.</li>
        <li><strong>Conditional Formatting:</strong>Applied conditional formatting in the heatmap to highlight sales peaks by hour.</li>
